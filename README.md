# Face-ID-Checking-Realtime

this Repo is used to Recognize an Image captured from a WebCam or from an Image.
It can detect and align the face first and then show the result.

To specify: 
-Main function is "main.py". If you want to recognize your face, uncomment the 44, 45 and 46 lines first, and also change the name ("Tu Vo Van" -> "your name")
-then run the "main.py" and press "Y"
-you can quit if you press "q"

Drop me a mess if you have further questions!

Tu Vo Van.
